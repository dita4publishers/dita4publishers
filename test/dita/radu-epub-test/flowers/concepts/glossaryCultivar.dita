    <glossdef>A <term>cultivar</term> is a cultivated plant that has been selected and given a
        unique name because of its decorative or useful characteristics; it is usually distinct from
        similar plants and when propagated it retains those characteristics. The word
            <term>cultivar</term> is generally regarded as a portmanteau of "<b>culti</b>vated" and
            "<b>var</b>iety", but could also be derived from "<b>culti</b>gen"
        "<b>var</b>iety".</glossdef>
