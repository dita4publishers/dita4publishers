  <title>DITA For Publishers Tools</title>
  <shortdesc>The DITA for Publishers tools provide implementations of the DITA Link Management API
    as well as utilities for using the implementations and doing useful things, such as getting key
    space reports and packaging DITA bounded object sets as Zip files (DITA Interchange Packages
    (DXP) packages).</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The main implementation classes are:<ul
        id="ul_e31ec00a-4eb9-4c42-957b-3e2707d7e8f8">
        <li>InMemoryDitaLinkManagementService—Provides a simple, non-persistent implementation of
          the DITA Link Management Service API. Useful for testing the API but not useful for
          production systems that require persistence. Can be used as the basis for implementing
          more sophisticated managers that provide persistence and integration with content
          management systems or XML repositories such as eXist and MarkLogic.</li>
        <li>InMemoryDitaKeySpace—A simple, non-persistent key space implementation. Used by the
          in-memory link management service and by the bos construction process, serves as an
          example of how to implement key space construction and access. Includes the ability to
          select effective keys based on dynamically specified filtering criteria.</li>
        <li>DitaBoundedObjectSetImpl—Implementation of the DITA bounded object set API. Provides
          access to the key space defined by the BOS' map tree as well as to all the members of the
          BOS.</li>
        <li>DitaUtil—A set of generic DITA utility methods and constants for working with DITA
          documents. Abstracts many of the DITA-specific details of DITA markup and makes it easier
          for task-specific code to be specialization aware. </li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The tools provided are:<ul
        id="ul_b887e258-eb17-4ff9-aa36-838bedd93c6b">
        <li>MapBosReporter—Command-line tool for constructing a map tree or full map BOS and
          reporting it to a text file or other format (using custom BOS reporters). Handy for
          debugging complex maps and key spaces.</li>
      </ul></p>
