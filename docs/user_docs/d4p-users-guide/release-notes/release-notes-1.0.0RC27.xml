      <title>Theme for the Release</title>
      <p>This release focuses on implementing support for both Open Toolkit 1.8.5 and 2.4+. It
        reflects some refactorings to the EPUB plugin provided by Jarno Elovirta that make it easier
        to extend.</p>
      <p>With this release there are now two sets of packages, one for OT 1.8.5 and one for
        2.4+.</p>
      <p>Note that release 1.0.0RC26 was just an initial experimental 2.4 version of the EPUB
        transform.</p>

      <title>EPUB Changes</title>
      <p>The main change Jarno made to the EPUB plugin was to move the import of the base
          <filepath>org.dita.xhtml/xsl/dita2xhtml.xsl</filepath>file from
          <filepath>dita2epubImpl.xsl</filepath> to <filepath>dita2epub_template.xsl</filepath>.</p>
      <p>This allows custom EPUB transforms to only have to override or duplicate the top-level
        transform file in order to change the set of module imports and override things more
        easily.</p>
      <p>Jarno also added a new initialization Ant target for the EPUB transform to make it easier
        to override properties or add new ones.</p>
      <p>The sample org.example.d4p.epub-custom plugin has been updated to replace the direct import
        of <filepath>dita2epubImpl.xsl</filepath> with import of the base
          <filepath>dita2epub.xsl</filepath> transform and also removing the direct include of the
          <filepath>dita.xhtml/xsl/dita2xhtml.xsl</filepath> file, which is now done by the
          <filepath>dita2epub.xsl</filepath> module.</p>
      <p>This change will likely require this same type of update to existing EPUB
        customizations.</p>
