        id="ul_gdd_xf4_tv">
        <li>Issue 72: Implemented new runtime parameters for including a single JavaScript file in
          the generated HTML files. See <xref
            keyref="epub.using-custom-javascript"/>.</li>
        <li>Issue 74: HTML files generated from topicheads had the wrong extension (resulted in
          epubcheck warning).</li>
        <li>Issue 70: Generate correct timestamps in metadata files (was not taking timezone into
          account).</li>
        <li>Fixed logic bug in generation of entries in list of tables (resulted in no entries for
          tables in the LoT).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also reflects earlier-released enhancements for font embedding and various small bug
        fixes.</p>

          id="ul_lqz_dfq_dx">
          <li>Fixes for issues related to chunking</li>
          <li>Fixes for issues related to resource-only topicrefs</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Word2DITA transformation framework:<ul
          id="ul_nph_nfq_dx">
          <li>Issue 29: Failure trying to load incorrect file for footnotes (transform would fail if
            there were footnote references in the Word document).</li>
          <li>Issue 26: Ensure that generated IDs are syntactically valid (some source filenames
            could result in invalid ID values).</li>
          <li>Issue 25: Fix handling of character \uF0FC (check mark) in Word source. Processing
            would fail with invalid character when Word source had checkmark characters.</li>
          <li>Issue 21: Use final-fixup mode for maps as well as topics. </li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>D4P vocabulary:<ul
          id="ul_uhd_bgq_dx">

            DTDs (D4P does not yet officially support DITA 1.3 but some D4P users have been using
            the DITA 1.3 learning2Domain wiht the d4pQuestionTopic topic type.</li>
          <li>Various minor fixes that do not affect document validity.</li>
        </ul></p>

          <li>Refactored maps into submaps.</li>
          <li>Added new vocabulary reference topics. These are still a work in progress but they
