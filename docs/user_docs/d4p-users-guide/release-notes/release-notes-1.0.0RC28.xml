        <li>Resolve a number of lingering issues with the Word2DITA framework.</li>
        <li>Update the D4P document type shells to use DITA 1.3 modules, including the new MathML,
          SVG, and equation domains.</li>
        <li>Update all D4P Open Toolkit plug-ins to work with OT 3.x (3.6.1 is the latest version as

      <title>Document Type Changes</title>
      <p>The D4P shells have been updated to reflect DITA 1.3:<ul id="ul_alt_q3v_kqb">
          <li>All references to specific DITA versions in references to standard DITA modules have
            been removed from shells.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P Math domain has been replaced by use of the DITA 1.3 math domain. The
            main change to documents is to replace the <xmlelement>d4p_math</xmlelement> element
            with the DITA 1.3 <xmlelement>math</xmlelement> element. Existing MathML markup should
            continue to be valid as is.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P SVG domain has been replaced by the use of the DITA 1.3 SVG
            domain.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P equation domain has been replaced by use of the DITA 1.3 equation
            domain. Documents will need to replace the D4P elements for equations with the
            equivalent DITA 1.3 elements.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P <xmlatt>renditionTarget</xmlatt> attribute domains has been replaced by
            use of the DITA 1.3 <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt> attribute domain. </li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>These changes are only to the D4P-provided document type shells. Custom shells are not
        affected. If you do not want to adopt these changes and you have been using the D4P-provided
        shells you will need to create your own shells by copying the pre-RC28 shells to your
        environment and associating them with public IDs or URNs that reflect your ownership (i.e.,
        create a new DITA Open Toolkit plug-in that provides your shells with your public IDs) and
        update your documents to use the new shells.</p>

        conversion facility as well as an interactive tool for working with and previewing Kindle
        books.</p>
