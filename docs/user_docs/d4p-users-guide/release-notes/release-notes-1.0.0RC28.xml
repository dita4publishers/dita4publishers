        <li>Resolve a number of lingering issues with the Word2DITA framework.</li>
        <li>Update the D4P document type shells to use DITA 1.3 modules, including the new MathML,
          SVG, and equation domains.</li>
        <li>Update all D4P Open Toolkit plug-ins to work with OT 3.x (3.6.1 is the latest version as

      <title>Document Type Changes</title>
      <p>The D4P shells have been updated to reflect DITA 1.3:<ul id="ul_alt_q3v_kqb">
          <li>All references to specific DITA versions in references to standard DITA modules have
            been removed from shells.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P Math domain has been replaced by use of the DITA 1.3 math domain. The
            main change to documents is to replace the <xmlelement>d4p_math</xmlelement> element
            with the DITA 1.3 <xmlelement>math</xmlelement> element. Existing MathML markup should
            continue to be valid as is.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P SVG domain has been replaced by the use of the DITA 1.3 SVG
            domain.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P equation domain has been replaced by use of the DITA 1.3 equation
            domain. Documents will need to replace the D4P elements for equations with the
            equivalent DITA 1.3 elements.</li>
          <li>Use of the D4P <xmlatt>renditionTarget</xmlatt> attribute domains has been replaced by
            use of the DITA 1.3 <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt> attribute domain. </li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>These changes are only to the D4P-provided document type shells. Custom shells are not
        affected. If you do not want to adopt these changes and you have been using the D4P-provided
        shells you will need to create your own shells by copying the pre-RC28 shells to your
        environment and associating them with public IDs or URNs that reflect your ownership (i.e.,
        create a new DITA Open Toolkit plug-in that provides your shells with your public IDs) and
        update your documents to use the new shells.</p>

      <title>Word2DITA Changes</title>
      <p>This release resolves a number of lingering issues:<ul id="ul_e33_tjv_kqb">
          <li>Issue 46: <b>Enable styling of direct character formatting</b>. Manual inline formats
            (bold, italic, underline, strikeout, subscript, and superscript) are now automatically
            styled by default. The style names reflect the DITA tag names for the natural target
            elements ("b", "i", "u", "line-through", "sub", and "sup"). Where multiple formats are
            applied to the same run, the style name reflects each style name separated by "-", i.e.,
            "b-i", "b-i-u", etc. These styles can then be mapped using normal
              <xmlelement>characterStyle</xmlelement> entries in the style-to-tag map. The built-in
            style2tagmap.xml file has a set of such mappings.<p>The built-in final-fixup mode
              includes processing to convert runs that reflect multiple styles into the
              corresponding nested elements. I.e., a run with the style "b-i" becomes
                <codeph>&lt;b>&lt;i>...&lt;/i>&lt;/b></codeph> in the final DITA.</p><p>The
              auto-styling is handled by a new mode defined in the
                <filepath>office-open-utils.xsl</filepath> module. Converting multi-format
                <xmlelement>ph</xmlelement> elements to nested elements is handled in the built-in
                <filepath>final-fixup.xsl</filepath> module.</p></li>
          <li>Issue 48: <b>Hyperlink @outputclass value not preserved</b>. Use any
              <xmlatt>outputclass</xmlatt> value specified for xref in style-to-tag map that maps to
            cross reference created from a complex ref field.</li>
          <li>Issue 49: <b>Table cell namest/nameend values not correctly calculated in the face of
              row spans</b>. The calculation of <xmlatt>namest</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>nameend</xmlatt>
            is now correct when horizontal spans occur to the right of a vertical span into the
            horizontal cells' row.</li>
          <li>Issue 50: <b>Capture table cell shading</b>. Table cell shading in Word tables is now
            captured using values in the <xmlatt>base</xmlatt> attribute of the generated
              <xmlelement>entry</xmlelement> element. Will capture either or both of the shading
            color (as the value specified in the Word data, normally a hex RGB value) and the
            shading pattern (as the pattern keyword specified in the Word data):
            <codeblock id="codeblock_nfk_b4v_kqb">&lt;entry <b>base="shade(#FFFF00)"</b>>&lt;p>&lt;b>Yellow shade header&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;/entry>
&lt;entry <b>base="shade(#4BACC6) shadePattern(diagCross)"</b>>&lt;p>&lt;b>Pattern
  cell&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;/entry></codeblock></li>
          <li>Issue 51: <b>topicZone for titlealts seems to be ignored</b>. Corrected generation of
            title alts to put them in the appropriate titlealts element. Added new processing in
            built-in final-fixup mode to handle correct output of title alts. Added new option
            "generateTitleAlts" on paragraphs that generate titles. When
              <xmlatt>generateTitleAlts</xmlatt>  is specified, the title content will be used to
            generate the specified elements within the configured <xmlelement>titlealts</xmlelement>
            element. Title alts will only be generated when the same-named title alt is not
            generated from a separate paragraph using a <xmlatt>topicZone</xmlatt> of
            "titlealts".</li>
          <li>Issue 52: <b>Runs between fnrefs/endnote refs in same para may be lost</b>. Refined
            how runs are handled to correct this behavior.</li>
          <li>Issue 53: <b>cross-references lost in DITA files</b>. Implemented general support for
            complex fields. REF fields to targets in the same document now result in working cross
            references.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>Kindle Generation Changes</title>
      <p>Amazon has replaced the older <cmdname>kindlegen</cmdname> tool with the
          <cmdname>kindlepreviewer</cmdname> tool, which provides both a command-line EPUB-to-MOBI
        conversion facility as well as an interactive tool for working with and previewing Kindle
        books.</p>
      <p>The D4P org.dita4publishers.kindle Open Toolkit plug-in has been updated to support the new
          <cmdname>kindlepreviewer</cmdname> tool as well as the older <cmdname>kindlegen</cmdname>
