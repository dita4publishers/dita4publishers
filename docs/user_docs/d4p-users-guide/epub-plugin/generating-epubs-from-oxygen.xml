 <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>You must have the EPUB plugin deployed to the Open Toolkit used by OxygenXML, normally in
        the <filepath>frameworks/dita/DITA-OT</filepath> directory under Oxygen's installation
        directory. You can also use a different Toolkit by changing the value of the
          <parmname>dita.dir</parmname> Ant parameter. OxygenXML comes with the EPUB transform
        pre-installed by default.</p>
      <p>These instructions reflect Oxygen version 16 and later (at least through version 18):</p>
      <p>To set up an EPUB transformation scenario in OxygenXML, do the following.</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>From either the main editing window or the DITA Maps Manager, open the "Configure Transformation Scenario" dialog (the little wrench and red arrow button in the toolbar).</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select "DITA OT Transformation" from the <uicontrol>Scenario Type</uicontrol> pulldown.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select the "DITA Map EPUB" transform and press the <uicontrol>Duplicate</uicontrol>
          button.</cmd>
        <stepresult>
          <p>The "Edit Scenario" dialog should open.</p>
        </stepresult>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Adjust the scenario name as you see fit to make it easy find later.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select the <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol> button to save the scenario.</cmd>
        <stepresult>
          <p>You should see your new scenario in the list of available DITA OT transformation scenarios.</p>
        </stepresult>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>
      <p>The scenario should be ready to use. You can test it by applying it to any DITA map. The
        EPUB file is generated in whatever you've configured as the output directory using the
        normal output location configuration (as specified in the Output tab of the transformation
        scenario configuration dialog; the default is <filepath>out/epub</filepath> in the directory
        containing the input map). </p>
      <p>If you select the "Open in browser" option in the transformation scenario's output options
        and you have an application associated with .epub files, such as Adobe Digital Editions, the
        newly-generated EPUB should open in that application. Note that in OxygenXML 12 and later
        you have the option of associating EPUB files with OxygenXML, which can open them in its
        Archive Browser. If you have that association, then doing "Open in browser" will open the
        EPUB in OxygenXML, not in an EPUB viewer.</p>
      <p>You can edit the scenario to add additional EPUB parameters as necessary. Simply open the scenario in the Scenario Editor, select the "add parameter" button, and create the parameter. The EPUB-specific parameters are documented in <xref keyref="epub-transformation-parameters"
/>.</p>
