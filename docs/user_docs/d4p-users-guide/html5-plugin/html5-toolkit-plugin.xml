 <conbody>
    <p>The HTML5 transformation type produces HTML5-based output that integrates HTML5 technologies.
      The resulting HTML5 provides dynamic and modern navigation and presentation. The supporting
      components such as the CSS style sheets and JavaScript used to render the HTML in browsers is
      designed to be easily adapted or replaced as required to provide specific navigation and
      presentation styles.</p>
   <p>The HTML5 plugin contains a <q>theme feature</q>. The theme feature, is an attempt to bring a way to register, 
     concatenate and compress css and javascript into a single theme.</p>
    <note>The HTML5 plugin does not use the HTML frames mechanism. </note>
    <note>The HTML5 plugin does not creates an index.html file by default. If you want an index.html
      file generated, simply rename your fist topic in the map to index.dita and place it at the
      same level than the map.</note>
