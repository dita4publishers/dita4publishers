 <title>The d4p javascript object reference</title>
 <shortdesc>The d4p javascript object allows developper to bring more user interface objects into the
  content.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The d4p object has been developped to be very modular, every objects should be easy to replaced if one of them does
   not do the job you need. </p>
  <p>The d4p object has been programmed using the <xref conref="" keyref="jquery"/> library. This does not mean that
   jQuery has to be used to develop custom modules, but jQuery has to be includes if you want to use the d4p objects and
   others modules.</p>
  <p>The d4p objects use AJAX techniques to load the content. The URI changed is triggered using the hashchange event.
   We will remove the hashchange once the new history api will be fully supported; this will allow to modify the URL
   without reloading the page. </p>
