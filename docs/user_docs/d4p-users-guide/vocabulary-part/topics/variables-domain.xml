  <title>Variables Domain</title>
  <shortdesc>The variables domain provides markup for declaring and referencing
    variables that are scoped by the map and topic hierarchy.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Variables are declared in map metadata, topicref metadata, topic prologs,
      and topic content. Variable definitions are specializations of
      <xmlelement>data</xmlelement> and may occur wherever <xmlelement>data</xmlelement> is
      allowed.</p>
    <p>References may occur anywhere that <xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement> or
      <xmlelement>text</xmlelement> is allowed.</p>
    <p>Variable resolution is done at output processing time, meaning the last
      step in a normal DITA process. This means that all content references and
      all filtering should have been applied by the time variable references and
      definitions are processed. This means you can use normal content reference
      and filtering facilities to determine the effective values of variable
      definitions and variable references.</p>
    <p>Note that as of D4P version 0.9.19 the Variables mechanism does not
      attempt to cover all use cases. It is intentionally simple so as to make
      implementation easy and foster use and experimentation in order to gather
      futher requirements. A complete variables facility, such as would be
      appropriate for inclusion in the DITA specification, could be quite a bit
      more complicated. </p>

    <title>Variable Definitions: <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definition</xmlelement> and
      <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definitions</xmlelement></title>
    <conbody>
      <p>Variable definitions are defined using the
        <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definition</xmlelement> element and always contained
        by the <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definitions</xmlelement>
        element:<codeblock>  &lt;topicmeta>
    <b>&lt;d4p-variable-definitions></b>
      <b>&lt;d4p-variable-definition</b> name="prodname"
       >&lt;tm>MyProduct&lt;/tm>&lt;/d4p-variable-definition>
    &lt;/d4p-variable-definitions>
  &lt;/topicmeta></codeblock></p>
      <p>The <xmlatt>name</xmlatt> attribute is the name of the variable, by
        which it is referenced using <xmlelement>d4p-variableref-keyword</xmlelement>
        or <xmlelement>d4p-variableref-text</xmlelement>. The name may be any string.
        Because it is defined in an XML attribute, any whitespace in the value
        will be normalized to single space characters. This allows you to use
        normal content as a variable name if appropriate, e.g.
        <codeph>&lt;d4p-variable-definition name="default value for
        variable">...</codeph> where that variable name could be appropriate as
        the default or fallback value for the variable, as the variable
        reference will simply be rendered as-is when there is no declaration for
        variable in the referencing scope.</p>
      <p>The variable value may be specified either using the
        <xmlatt>value</xmlatt> attribute or in the content of the
        <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definition</xmlelement> element. If
        <xmlatt>value</xmlatt> is specified then the content of the element is
        ignored. This allows you to use the content of the variable definition
        as documentation for the variable if you choose.</p>
      <p>If you put the variable value in the content then you may use any
        markup allowed where the variable reference is allowed (or, more
        accurately, where the content can be usefully and correctly processed,
        which is not quite the same thing).</p>
      <p>Note that variable references are not content references and so the
        same strict content model consistency constraints do not necessarily
        apply. However, you should be careful to only put markup in variables
        that will be correctly and appropriately processed in the context where
        the variables are referenced. In practice, this means limiting your
        content to normal inline markup and avoiding things like footnotes,
        cross references, block elements, and so on. If you want to impose more
        constraints on what is allowed in variable definitions, you can use
        constraint modules or further specialization to do so. The base markup
        as defined by the D4P project errs on the side of generality.</p>
      <p>The <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definitions</xmlelement> element serves to group
        and label sets of variable definitions. The element may have an initial
        <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element, which serves as a descriptive label
        for the group, and <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definitions</xmlelement> may be
        nested:<codeblock>  ...
  &lt;prolog>
    <b>&lt;d4p-variable-definitions></b>
      <b>&lt;title>Top-level variable definitions&lt;/title></b>
      <b>&lt;d4p-variable-definitions></b>
        <b>&lt;title>Nested variable definitions element&lt;/title></b>
        &lt;d4p-variable-definition-fallback
          name="varFallbackDefinedInRootTopic">This is the fallback value defined
          in the root topic&lt;/d4p-variable-definition-fallback>
      &lt;/d4p-variable-definitions>
    &lt;/d4p-variable-definitions>
  &lt;/prolog>
  ...</codeblock></p>
      <p>When resolving variables, the first definition within a given scope
        (containing element) in document order wins, so in the case of nested
        <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definitions</xmlelement> elements, the nesting is not
        significant, only the order of the definitions in normal depth-first
        tree order. This means that a definition contained by the top-level
        variable definitions group but occurring after all nested variable
        definition groups could be overridden by a definition within any of the
        nested groups. You can take advantage of this behavior to have "default"
        values that may be overridden by nested groups used by reference.</p>

    <title>Fallback values:
      <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definition-fallback</xmlelement></title>
    <conbody>
      <p>For topics that may used in many contexts, you often want to have
        fallback values for the variables referenced from those topics so that
        when those variables are not declared at all, an appropriate value is
        used, such as "variable XXX not defined" or an appropriate default
        value, or whatever. Fallback values are used only when there is no other
        in-scope declaration of the variable. That is, you don't want the
        fallback value to override attempts to set the variable. </p>
      <p>Fallback values are declared using the
        <xmlelement>d4p-variable-definition-fallback</xmlelement> element, normally
        within topic prologs, although you can declare fallback values within
        any scope, just as for other variables.</p>
      <p>Fallback values are used only when there is no other in-scope
        definition of the variable. This includes definitions in the same scope
        as the fallback, meaning that if you have both a fallback and normal
        definition of the same variable name in the same scope, the fallback
        will never be used. You might have this case if you have a set of
        fallback values that are reused by conref and you happen, in one use
        context, to also define a value for the variable. In that case, the
        existence of the fallback will not interfere with the other definition
        of the variable.</p>

    <title>Variable References: <xmlelement>d4p-variableref_keyword</xmlelement> and
      <xmlelement>d4p-variableref_text</xmlelement></title>
    <conbody>
      <p>Variables may be referenced in any context where
        <xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement> or <xmlelement>text</xmlelement> are allowed, using
        the corresponding specialization,
        <xmlelement>d4p-variableref_keyword</xmlelement> or
        <xmlelement>d4p-variableref_text</xmlelement>.</p>
      <p>The content of the reference element is the variable
        name:<codeblock>&lt;p>The <b>&lt;d4p-variableref_keyword>prodname&lt;/d4p-variableref_keyword></b> 
product...&lt;/p></codeblock></p>
      <p>If the variable cannot be resolved (or you don't have processing
        support for D4P variables installed), then the content of the reference
        element is used, just as for normal <xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement> or
        <xmlelement>text</xmlelement> processing. If the variable can be resolved,
        then the nearest variable definition is used to determine the effective
        value.</p>
      <p>The effective binding for a variable is determined as follows:<ol
        id="ol_h1g_r1m_y3">
        <li>In all cases, only the direct element and map tree ancestry of the
          reference is considered, with the exception of topic prologs, which
          always appy to the entire topic (including the topic title).
          Definitions in sibling topics, maps, or topicrefs are never considered
          for the purpose of determining the effective definition for a given
          reference. </li>
        <li>The nearest definition within ancestor elements determines the
          effective binding. For elements within topics, this includes any
          ancestry within the topic body as well as definitions within the
          topic's prolog. Note that the placement of the definition within the
          ancestor is not importantâ€”in particular, the variable definition could
          come after the subelement that contains the reference. </li>
        <li>For topics referenced from maps, if there is no definition within
          the topic, then the nearest definition in the map tree ancestry
          determines the effective binding. That is, definitions are scoped by
          topicrefs such that the definition in the nearest topicref to the
          topic that references the topic provides the binding.</li>
        <li>If the variable is not defined within the topic or within any
          topicref in the map tree ancestry, then any definition within the
          map's metadata is used. This means that root maps may define default
          values for variables.</li>
        <li>If a variable is not defined anywhere, processors may choose to
          provide default values or otherwise allow for run-time definition of
          variables.</li>
        </ol></p>
      <note>Because submap metadata is not always maintained or necessarily even
        available in all processing contexts, variables defined in the
        <xmlelement>topicmeta</xmlelement> child of submap elements will be ignored.
        If you want to define variables in submaps, use a wrapper topicref
        element around the topicrefs, either <xmlelement>topicgroup</xmlelement> or
        another allowed topicref type.</note>
      <p>Stated more informally, the intent of these rules is that elements
        define variable scopes within topics and topicrefs define scopes within
        maps.</p>
      <p>Note: Within topics, only references defined within topic documents are
        consideredâ€”topics related into a hierarchy via maps do not affect the
        variable definitions within each other, meaning that variable resolution
        processors do not need to look in map-defined ancestor topics for
        variable definitions, only literal ancestor topics within the same XML
        document. However, if topics are merged because of normal DITA
        <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> processing or via some type of topic merging,
        such as is done for the Toolkit's PDF processing, then
        previously-separate XML documents may become single XML documents and
        thus affect variable resolution. However, this would normally only
        affect fallback values such that a variable reference for which there
        was no fallback (because none was defined in the topic's direct XML
        ancestry) would now have a fallback or a defined value, because one was
        defined in an ancestor in the merged document. Because the nearest
        definition to a reference is the always used, it is not possible for
        chunking and merging to affect the values of variables defined in the
        original XML ancestry.</p>
