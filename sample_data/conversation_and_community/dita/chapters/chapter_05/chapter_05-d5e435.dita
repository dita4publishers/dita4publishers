The best approach is to read the <indexterm>forums<indexterm>participating in</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>forums<indexterm>moderating</indexterm></indexterm>forum regularly for a while to get a sense of the
            <indexterm>conversations<indexterm>joining</indexterm></indexterm>community that exists,
          how often people post, the amount of time it typically takes for questions to be answered,
          and the key contributors to the site. After you gain a feel for the appropriate approach,
          style, and tone for your messages, start by answering questions, and be sure to disclose
          your employer. </p><p>Consider becoming a moderator only after you have been a participant for a while. Most
          online <indexterm>communities<indexterm>participation
          in</indexterm></indexterm>communities do not recognize any sense of entitlement that you
          may have because of your employer. Instead, you must earn the <indexterm>communities<indexterm>trust within</indexterm></indexterm>community’s trust and offer
          real help, even if you only provide links to your online help. Teaching the community to
          fish (for information) feeds them longer than just answering questions without citing how
          you learned the information yourself.</p></body></subsection>
