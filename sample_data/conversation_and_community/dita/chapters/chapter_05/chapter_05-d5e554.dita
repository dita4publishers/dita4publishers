          </fn> users can use a desktop tool to capture screenshots or screencasts, which are videos
          showing the computer screen that are often narrated with a voice script to explain what is
          happening on the screen. The related website hosts the image or video files for playback.
          Photos may be the best solution to showing sequential instructions rather than writing
          them out, or even using complicated 3D modeling software. For example, a Lego fan posted

          </fn> with Legos by laying out the Lego pieces, taking photos, and putting the whole
          collage together with some text for instructions.<fn>
