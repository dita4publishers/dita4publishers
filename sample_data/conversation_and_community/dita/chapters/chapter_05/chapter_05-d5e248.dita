        designing or providing <indexterm>blogs<indexterm>infrastructure</indexterm></indexterm>infrastructure for customer <indexterm>blogs<indexterm>customer</indexterm></indexterm>blogs. This type of service is better
        performed by the website management department, marketing, or sales department, which can
        track generated leads more easily, or by the customer support department, which has a
        business goal of customers helping other customers. Sometimes a valuable internal
        communications device is started by someone on their own time with a server under their
        desk. For inspiration, read Groundswell for case studies such as the Best Buy internal blog
