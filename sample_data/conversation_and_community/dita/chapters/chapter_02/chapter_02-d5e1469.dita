<subsection id="d5e1469"><title>Learning about social media</title><body><p>Finding a definition for a word like “wiki” can be difficult due to the proliferation of
        the word wiki used in web pages that may not be relevant to the topic of wikis. From
        Cookiepedia to Wookiepedia, there are many wikis in use that may interfere with discovering
        the definition that suits your content’s needs. One method for searching for a definition of
        an unfamiliar term is to use the <indexterm>Google<indexterm>define-
          command</indexterm></indexterm>Google <indexterm>definitions, searching for</indexterm><ph>define:</ph> command. For example, in the Google search box type “define: wiki” to get a
        list of web pages that offer definitions for the word “wiki.” </p><p>You also learn best about social media and tools for the social web by trying them
        yourself. If your company does not have a need to use these tools yet, try them for personal
        uses or as a volunteer for a non-profit cause.</p></body></subsection>
