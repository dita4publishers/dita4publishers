<p>Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages
when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.

</p>
<p>"My darling child!" she cried, folding the little girl in her
arms and covering her face with kisses.  "Where in the world did
you come from?"

</p>
<p>"From the Land of Oz," said Dorothy gravely.  "And here is
Toto, too.  And oh, Aunt Em!  I'm so glad to be at home again!"
