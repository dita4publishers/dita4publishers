  <title>Introduction</title>
  <body>
    <p>Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every
      healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and
      manifestly unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to
      childish hearts than all other human creations. </p>
    <p>Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as
      "historical" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer "wonder
      tales" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the
      horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to
      each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only
      entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident. </p>
    <p>Having this thought in mind, the story of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" was written solely to
      please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment
      and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out. </p>
