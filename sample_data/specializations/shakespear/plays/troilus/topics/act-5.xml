            <line>Both taxing me and gaging me to keep</line>

            <line>With too much blood and too little brain, these two</line>

            <line>not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire</line>
            <line>against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I</line>

      <title>SCENE X.  Another part of the plains.</title>
      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter AENEAS and Trojans</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
            <line>Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:</line>
            <line>Never go home; here starve we out the night.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter TROILUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Hector is slain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALL</speaker>
            <line>Hector! the gods forbid!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,</line>
            <line>In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.</line>
            <line>Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!</line>
            <line>Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!</line>
            <line>I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,</line>
            <line>And linger not our sure destructions on!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
            <line>My lord, you do discomfort all the host!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>You understand me not that tell me so:</line>
            <line>I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,</line>
            <line>But dare all imminence that gods and men</line>
            <line>Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:</line>
            <line>Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?</line>
            <line>Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,</line>
            <line>Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:</line>
            <line>There is a word will Priam turn to stone;</line>
            <line>Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,</line>
            <line>Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,</line>
            <line>Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:</line>
            <line>Hector is dead; there is no more to say.</line>
            <line>Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,</line>
            <line>Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,</line>
            <line>Let Titan rise as early as he dare,</line>
            <line>I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,</line>
            <line>No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:</line>
            <line>I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,</line>
            <line>That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.</line>
            <line>Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:</line>
            <line>Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans</stagedir>
         <stagedir>As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other
side, PANDARUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>But hear you, hear you!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame</line>
            <line>Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!</line>
            <line>world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!</line>
            <line>O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set</line>
            <line>a-work, and how ill requited! why should our</line>
            <line>endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?</line>
            <line>what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:</line>
            <line>Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,</line>
            <line>Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;</line>
            <line>And being once subdued in armed tail,</line>
            <line>Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.</line>
            <line>Good traders in the flesh, set this in your</line>
            <line>painted cloths.</line>
            <line>As many as be here of pander's hall,</line>
            <line>Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;</line>
            <line>Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,</line>
            <line>Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.</line>
            <line>Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,</line>
            <line>Some two months hence my will shall here be made:</line>
            <line>It should be now, but that my fear is this,</line>
            <line>Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:</line>
            <line>Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,</line>
            <line>And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.</line>
