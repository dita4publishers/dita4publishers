            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>My very worthy cousin, fairly met!</line>
            <line>Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.</line>

            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Many and hearty thankings to you both.</line>
            <line>We have made inquiry of you; and we hear</line>
            <line>Such goodness of your justice, that our soul</line>
            <line>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,</line>
            <line>Forerunning more requital.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>You make my bonds still greater.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,</line>
            <line>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,</line>
            <line>When it deserves, with characters of brass,</line>
            <line>A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time</line>
            <line>And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,</line>
            <line>And let the subject see, to make them know</line>
            <line>That outward courtesies would fain proclaim</line>
            <line>Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,</line>
            <line>You must walk by us on our other hand;</line>
            <line>And good supporters are you.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR PETER</speaker>
            <line>Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard</line>
            <line>Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!</line>
            <line>O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye</line>
            <line>By throwing it on any other object</line>
            <line>Till you have heard me in my true complaint</line>
            <line>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.</line>
            <line>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:</line>
            <line>Reveal yourself to him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O worthy duke,</line>
            <line>You bid me seek redemption of the devil:</line>
            <line>Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak</line>
            <line>Must either punish me, not being believed,</line>
            <line>Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:</line>
            <line>She hath been a suitor to me for her brother</line>
            <line>Cut off by course of justice,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>By course of justice!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>And she will speak most bitterly and strange.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:</line>
            <line>That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?</line>
            <line>That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?</line>
            <line>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,</line>
            <line>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;</line>
            <line>Is it not strange and strange?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, it is ten times strange.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>It is not truer he is Angelo</line>
            <line>Than this is all as true as it is strange:</line>
            <line>Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth</line>
            <line>To the end of reckoning.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Away with her! Poor soul,</line>
            <line>She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest</line>
            <line>There is another comfort than this world,</line>
            <line>That thou neglect me not, with that opinion</line>
            <line>That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible</line>
            <line>That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible</line>
            <line>But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,</line>
            <line>May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute</line>
            <line>As Angelo; even so may Angelo,</line>
            <line>In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,</line>
            <line>Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:</line>
            <line>If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,</line>
            <line>Had I more name for badness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>By mine honesty,</line>
            <line>If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--</line>
            <line>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,</line>
            <line>Such a dependency of thing on thing,</line>
            <line>As e'er I heard in madness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O gracious duke,</line>
            <line>Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason</line>
            <line>For inequality; but let your reason serve</line>
            <line>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</line>
            <line>And hide the false seems true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Many that are not mad</line>
            <line>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>I am the sister of one Claudio,</line>
            <line>Condemn'd upon the act of fornication</line>
            <line>To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:</line>
            <line>I, in probation of a sisterhood,</line>
            <line>Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio</line>
            <line>As then the messenger,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>That's I, an't like your grace:</line>
            <line>I came to her from Claudio, and desired her</line>
            <line>To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</line>
            <line>For her poor brother's pardon.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>That's he indeed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>You were not bid to speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>No, my good lord;</line>
            <line>Nor wish'd to hold my peace.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>I wish you now, then;</line>
            <line>Pray you, take note of it: and when you have</line>
            <line>A business for yourself, pray heaven you then</line>
            <line>Be perfect.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>I warrant your honour.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Right.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>It may be right; but you are i' the wrong</line>
            <line>To speak before your time. Proceed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>I went</line>
            <line>To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>That's somewhat madly spoken.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Pardon it;</line>
            <line>The phrase is to the matter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Mended again. The matter; proceed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>In brief, to set the needless process by,</line>
            <line>How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,</line>
            <line>How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--</line>
            <line>For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion</line>
            <line>I now begin with grief and shame to utter:</line>
            <line>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</line>
            <line>To his concupiscible intemperate lust,</line>
            <line>Release my brother; and, after much debatement,</line>
            <line>My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,</line>
            <line>And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,</line>
            <line>His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant</line>
            <line>For my poor brother's head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>This is most likely!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O, that it were as like as it is true!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,</line>
            <line>Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour</line>
            <line>In hateful practise. First, his integrity</line>
            <line>Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason</line>
            <line>That with such vehemency he should pursue</line>
            <line>Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,</line>
            <line>He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself</line>
            <line>And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:</line>
            <line>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</line>
            <line>Thou camest here to complain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>And is this all?</line>
            <line>Then, O you blessed ministers above,</line>
            <line>Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time</line>
            <line>Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up</line>
            <line>In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,</line>
            <line>As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!</line>
            <line>To prison with her! Shall we thus permit</line>
            <line>A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall</line>
            <line>On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.</line>
            <line>Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;</line>
            <line>I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord</line>
            <line>For certain words he spake against your grace</line>
            <line>In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!</line>
            <line>And to set on this wretched woman here</line>
            <line>Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</line>
            <line>I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,</line>
            <line>A very scurvy fellow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR PETER</speaker>
            <line>Blessed be your royal grace!</line>
            <line>I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</line>
            <line>Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman</line>
            <line>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,</line>
            <line>Who is as free from touch or soil with her</line>
            <line>As she from one ungot.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>We did believe no less.</line>
            <line>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR PETER</speaker>
            <line>I know him for a man divine and holy;</line>
            <line>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,</line>
            <line>As he's reported by this gentleman;</line>
            <line>And, on my trust, a man that never yet</line>
            <line>Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, most villanously; believe it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR PETER</speaker>
            <line>Well, he in time may come to clear himself;</line>
            <line>But at this instant he is sick my lord,</line>
            <line>Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,</line>
            <line>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint</line>
            <line>Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,</line>
            <line>To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know</line>
            <line>Is true and false; and what he with his oath</line>
            <line>And all probation will make up full clear,</line>
            <line>Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.</line>
            <line>To justify this worthy nobleman,</line>
            <line>So vulgarly and personally accused,</line>
            <line>Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,</line>
            <line>Till she herself confess it.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Good friar, let's hear it.</line>
            <stagedir>ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward</stagedir>
            <line>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?</line>
            <line>O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!</line>
            <line>Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;</line>
            <line>In this I'll be impartial; be you judge</line>
            <line>Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?</line>
            <line>First, let her show her face, and after speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARIANA</speaker>
            <line>Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face</line>

            <line>For that her reputation was disvalued</line>
