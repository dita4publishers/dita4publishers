            <line>I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer</line>
            <line>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch</line>
            <line>uncapable of pity, void and empty</line>
            <line>From any dram of mercy.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>I have heard</line>
            <line>Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify</line>
            <line>His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate</line>
            <line>And that no lawful means can carry me</line>
            <line>Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose</line>
            <line>My patience to his fury, and am arm'd</line>
            <line>To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,</line>
            <line>The very tyranny and rage of his.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Make room, and let him stand before our face.</line>
            <line>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</line>
            <line>That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice</line>
            <line>To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought</line>
            <line>Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</line>
            <line>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</line>
            <line>And where thou now exact'st the penalty,</line>
            <line>Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,</line>
            <line>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</line>
            <line>But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,</line>
            <line>Forgive a moiety of the principal;</line>
            <line>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</line>
            <line>That have of late so huddled on his back,</line>
            <line>Enow to press a royal merchant down</line>
            <line>And pluck commiseration of his state</line>
            <line>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,</line>
            <line>From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd</line>
            <line>To offices of tender courtesy.</line>
            <line>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;</line>
            <line>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</line>
            <line>To have the due and forfeit of my bond:</line>
            <line>If you deny it, let the danger light</line>
            <line>Upon your charter and your city's freedom.</line>
            <line>You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have</line>
            <line>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</line>
            <line>Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:</line>
            <line>But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?</line>
            <line>What if my house be troubled with a rat</line>
            <line>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</line>
            <line>To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?</line>
            <line>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</line>
            <line>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;</line>
            <line>And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,</line>
            <line>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</line>
            <line>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</line>
            <line>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</line>
            <line>As there is no firm reason to be render'd,</line>
            <line>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</line>
            <line>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</line>
            <line>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force</line>
            <line>Must yield to such inevitable shame</line>
            <line>As to offend, himself being offended;</line>
            <line>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</line>
            <line>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</line>
            <line>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</line>
            <line>A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
            <line>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</line>
            <line>To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I am not bound to please thee with my answers.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
            <line>Do all men kill the things they do not love?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
            <line>Every offence is not a hate at first.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, think you question with the Jew:</line>
            <line>You may as well go stand upon the beach</line>
            <line>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;</line>
            <line>You may as well use question with the wolf</line>
            <line>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;</line>
            <line>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</line>
            <line>To wag their high tops and to make no noise,</line>
            <line>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</line>
            <line>You may as well do anything most hard,</line>
            <line>As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--</line>
            <line>His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,</line>
            <line>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</line>
            <line>But with all brief and plain conveniency</line>
            <line>Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
            <line>For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>What judgment shall I dread, doing</line>
            <line>Were in six parts and every part a ducat,</line>
            <line>I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</line>
            <line>You have among you many a purchased slave,</line>
            <line>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,</line>
            <line>You use in abject and in slavish parts,</line>
            <line>Because you bought them: shall I say to you,</line>
            <line>Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</line>
            <line>Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds</line>
            <line>Be made as soft as yours and let their palates</line>
            <line>Be season'd with such viands? You will answer</line>
            <line>'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:</line>
            <line>The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,</line>
            <line>Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.</line>
            <line>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</line>
            <line>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</line>
            <line>I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</line>

            <line>Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!</line>
            <line>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,</line>
            <line>Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</line>

            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>I am a tainted wether of the flock,</line>
            <line>Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit</line>
            <line>Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me</line>
            <line>You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,</line>

            <line>Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,</line>
            <line>Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,</line>
            <line>No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness</line>
            <line>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</line>

            <line>And for thy life let justice be accused.</line>
            <line>Thou almost makest me waver in my faith</line>

            <line>That souls of animals infuse themselves</line>
            <line>Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit</line>
            <line>Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,</line>
            <line>Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,</line>
            <line>And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,</line>
            <line>Infused itself in thee; for thy desires</line>

            <line>your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that</line>
            <line>your messenger came, in loving visitation was with</line>
            <line>me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I</line>
            <line>acquainted him with the cause in controversy between</line>
            <line>the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er</line>
            <line>many books together: he is furnished with my</line>
            <line>opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the</line>
            <line>greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes</line>
            <line>with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's</line>
            <line>request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of</line>
            <line>years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend</line>
            <line>estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so</line>
            <line>old a head. I leave him to your gracious</line>

            <line>The throned monarch better than his crown;</line>
            <line>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</line>
            <line>The attribute to awe and majesty,</line>
            <line>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</line>
            <line>But mercy is above this sceptred sway;</line>
            <line>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</line>
            <line>It is an attribute to God himself;</line>
            <line>And earthly power doth then show likest God's</line>
            <line>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</line>
            <line>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</line>
            <line>That, in the course of justice, none of us</line>
            <line>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;</line>
            <line>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</line>
            <line>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</line>
            <line>To mitigate the justice of thy plea;</line>
            <line>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</line>
            <line>Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</line>
            <line>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>Is he not able to discharge the money?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
            <line>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;</line>
            <line>Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,</line>
            <line>I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,</line>
            <line>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:</line>
            <line>If this will not suffice, it must appear</line>
            <line>That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,</line>
            <line>Wrest once the law to your authority:</line>
            <line>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</line>
            <line>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>It must not be; there is no power in Venice</line>
            <line>Can alter a decree established:</line>
            <line>'Twill be recorded for a precedent,</line>
            <line>And many an error by the same example</line>
            <line>Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</line>

            <line>A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!</line>
            <line>O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:</line>
            <line>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</line>
            <line>No, not for Venice.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>Why, this bond is forfeit;</line>
            <line>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</line>
            <line>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</line>
            <line>Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:</line>
            <line>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>When it is paid according to the tenor.</line>
            <line>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</line>
            <line>You know the law, your exposition</line>
            <line>Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,</line>
            <line>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</line>
            <line>Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear</line>
            <line>There is no power in the tongue of man</line>
            <line>To alter me: I stay here on my bond.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>Most heartily I do beseech the court</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>Why then, thus it is:</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>For the intent and purpose of the law</line>
            <line>Hath full relation to the penalty,</line>

            <line>Ay, his breast:</line>
            <line>So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?</line>
            <line>'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>It is so. Are there balance here to weigh</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>It is not so express'd: but what of that?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.</line>

            <line>Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!</line>
            <line>Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;</line>
            <line>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind</line>
            <line>Than is her custom: it is still her use</line>
            <line>To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,</line>
            <line>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow</line>
            <line>An age of poverty; from which lingering penance</line>
            <line>Of such misery doth she cut me off.</line>
            <line>Commend me to your honourable wife:</line>
            <line>Tell her the process of Antonio's end;</line>
            <line>Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;</line>
            <line>And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge</line>
            <line>Whether Bassanio had not once a love.</line>
            <line>Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,</line>
            <line>And he repents not that he pays your debt;</line>
            <line>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:</line>

            <line>It is enacted in the laws of Venice,</line>
            <line>If it be proved against an alien</line>
            <line>That by direct or indirect attempts</line>
            <line>He seek the life of any citizen,</line>
            <line>The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive</line>

            <line>Comes to the privy coffer of the state;</line>

            <line>Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.</line>
            <line>In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;</line>
            <line>For it appears, by manifest proceeding,</line>

            <line>Thou hast contrived against the very life</line>
            <line>Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd</line>
            <line>The danger formerly by me rehearsed.</line>
