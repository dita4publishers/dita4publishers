            <line>On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse</line>

            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,</line>

            <line>When corn was given them gratis, you repined;</line>
            <line>Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them</line>
            <line>Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, this was known before.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Not to them all.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SICINIUS</speaker>
            <line>You show too much of that</line>
            <line>For which the people stir: if you will pass</line>
            <line>To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,</line>
            <line>Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,</line>
            <line>Or never be so noble as a consul,</line>
            <line>Nor yoke with him for tribune.</line>

            <speaker>COMINIUS</speaker>
            <line>The people are abused; set on. This paltering</line>
            <line>Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus</line>
            <line>Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely</line>
            <line>I' the plain way of his merit.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Tell me of corn!</line>
            <line>This was my speech, and I will speak't again--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Not now, not now.</line>

            <speaker>First Senator</speaker>
            <line>Not in this heat, sir, now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,</line>
            <line>I crave their pardons:</line>
            <line>For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them</line>
            <line>Regard me as I do not flatter, and</line>
            <line>Therein behold themselves: I say again,</line>
            <line>In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate</line>
            <line>The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,</line>
            <line>Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,</line>
            <line>and scatter'd,</line>
            <line>By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,</line>
            <line>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that</line>
            <line>Which they have given to beggars.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, no more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Senator</speaker>
            <line>No more words, we beseech you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>How! no more!</line>
            <line>As for my country I have shed my blood,</line>
            <line>Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs</line>
            <line>Coin words till their decay against those measles,</line>
            <line>Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought</line>
            <line>The very way to catch them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>You speak o' the people,</line>
            <line>As if you were a god to punish, not</line>
            <line>A man of their infirmity.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SICINIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Twere well</line>
            <line>We let the people know't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>What, what? his choler?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Choler!</line>
            <line>Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,</line>
            <line>By Jove, 'twould be my mind!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SICINIUS</speaker>
            <line>It is a mind</line>
            <line>That shall remain a poison where it is,</line>
            <line>Not poison any further.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Shall remain!</line>
            <line>Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you</line>
            <line>His absolute 'shall'?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COMINIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Twas from the canon.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>'Shall'!</line>
            <line>O good but most unwise patricians! why,</line>
            <line>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</line>
            <line>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,</line>
            <line>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but</line>
            <line>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit</line>
            <line>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</line>
            <line>And make your channel his? If he have power</line>
            <line>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</line>
            <line>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</line>
            <line>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</line>
            <line>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</line>
            <line>If they be senators: and they are no less,</line>
            <line>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste</line>
            <line>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</line>
            <line>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'</line>
            <line>His popular 'shall' against a graver bench</line>
            <line>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!</line>
            <line>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches</line>
            <line>To know, when two authorities are up,</line>
            <line>Neither supreme, how soon confusion</line>
            <line>May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take</line>
            <line>The one by the other.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COMINIUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, on to the market-place.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth</line>
            <line>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used</line>
            <line>Sometime in Greece,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, well, no more of that.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>Though there the people had more absolute power,</line>
            <line>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed</line>
            <line>The ruin of the state.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, shall the people give</line>
            <line>One that speaks thus their voice?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>I'll give my reasons,</line>
            <line>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</line>
            <line>Was not our recompense, resting well assured</line>
            <line>That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,</line>
            <line>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,</line>
            <line>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</line>
            <line>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war</line>
            <line>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</line>
            <line>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</line>
            <line>Which they have often made against the senate,</line>
            <line>All cause unborn, could never be the motive</line>
            <line>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</line>
            <line>How shall this bisson multitude digest</line>
            <line>The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express</line>
            <line>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;</line>
            <line>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</line>
            <line>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase</line>
            <line>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</line>
            <line>Call our cares fears; which will in time</line>
            <line>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in</line>
            <line>The crows to peck the eagles.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Come, enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Enough, with over-measure.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIOLANUS</speaker>
            <line>No, take more:</line>
            <line>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</line>
            <line>Seal what I end withal! This double worship,</line>
            <line>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</line>
            <line>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,</line>
            <line>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</line>
            <line>Of general ignorance,--it must omit</line>
            <line>Real necessities, and give way the while</line>

            <line>Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love</line>
            <line>My country's good with a respect more tender,</line>
            <line>More holy and profound, than mine own life,</line>
            <line>My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,</line>

            <line>Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,</line>
            <line>Fan you into despair! Have the power still</line>
