            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</line>
            <line>no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
            <line>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen</line>
            <line>her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon</line>
            <line>her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,</line>
            <line>write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again</line>
            <line>return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once</line>
            <line>the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</line>
            <line>watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her</line>
            <line>walking and other actual performances, what, at any</line>
            <line>time, have you heard her say?</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>

            <stagedir>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</stagedir>
            <line>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;</line>
            <line>and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.</line>

            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but their sense is shut.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
            <line>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus</line>
            <line>washing her hands: I have known her continue in</line>
            <line>this a quarter of an hour.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,</line>
            <line>then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my</line>
            <line>lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we</line>
            <line>fear who knows it, when none can call our power to</line>
            <line>account?--Yet who would have thought the old man</line>
            <line>to have had so much blood in him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>Do you mark that?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--</line>
            <line>What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'</line>
            <line>that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with</line>
            <line>this starting.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
            <line>She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of</line>
            <line>that: heaven knows what she has known.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the</line>
            <line>perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little</line>
            <line>hand. Oh, oh, oh!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
            <line>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
            <line>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the</line>

            <line>This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known</line>

            <line>To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:</line>
            <line>come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's</line>

            <line>Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds</line>
            <line>Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds</line>
            <line>To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:</line>
            <line>More needs she the divine than the physician.</line>
            <line>God, God forgive us all! Look after her;</line>
            <line>Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</line>
            <line>And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:</line>
            <line>My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.</line>
            <line>I think, but dare not speak.</line>

            <line>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:</line>
            <line>He only lived but till he was a man;</line>
            <line>The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd</line>
            <line>In the unshrinking station where he fought,</line>

            <line>Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow</line>
