            <line>from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:</line>
            <line>you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the</line>
            <line>easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her</line>

            <line>Faith, it does me; though it discolours the</line>
            <line>complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>POINS</speaker>
            <line>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as</line>
            <line>to remember so weak a composition.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
            <line>Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,</line>
            <line>by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,</line>
            <line>small beer. But, indeed, these humble</line>
            <line>considerations make me out of love with my</line>
            <line>greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember</line>
            <line>thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to</line>
            <line>take note how many pair of silk stockings thou</line>
            <line>hast, viz. these, and those that were thy</line>
            <line>peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy</line>
            <line>shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for</line>
            <line>use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better</line>
            <line>than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when</line>
            <line>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done</line>
            <line>a great while, because the rest of thy low</line>
            <line>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:</line>
            <line>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins</line>
            <line>of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the</line>
            <line>midwives say the children are not in the fault;</line>

            <line>How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,</line>
            <line>you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good</line>

            <speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
            <line>Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be</line>

            <line>thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a</line>
            <line>better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad</line>
            <line>indeed too.</line>

            <speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
            <line>By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's</line>
            <line>book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and</line>
            <line>persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell</line>
            <line>thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so</line>
            <line>sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art</line>
            <line>hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>POINS</speaker>
            <line>The reason?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POINS</speaker>
            <line>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
            <line>It would be every man's thought; and thou art a</line>
            <line>blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never</line>
            <line>a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way</line>
            <line>better than thine: every man would think me an</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>POINS</speaker>
            <line>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much</line>

            <line>me is that I am a second brother and that I am a</line>
