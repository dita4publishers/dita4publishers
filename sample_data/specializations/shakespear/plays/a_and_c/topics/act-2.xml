            <line>I shall do well:</line>
            <line>The people love me, and the sea is mine;</line>
            <line>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</line>
            <line>Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony</line>
            <line>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</line>
            <line>No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where</line>
            <line>He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,</line>
            <line>Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,</line>

            <line>Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!</line>
            <line>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</line>
            <line>Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks</line>
            <line>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;</line>

            <line>I could have given less matter</line>

            <line>This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm</line>
            <line>For such a petty war: his soldiership</line>
            <line>Is twice the other twain: but let us rear</line>
            <line>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</line>
            <line>Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck</line>

            <line>I cannot hope</line>

            <line>His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;</line>
            <line>His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,</line>

            <line>Were't not that we stand up against them all,</line>
            <line>'Twere pregnant they should square between</line>
            <line>themselves;</line>
            <line>For they have entertained cause enough</line>
            <line>To draw their swords: but how the fear of us</line>
            <line>May cement their divisions and bind up</line>
            <line>The petty difference, we yet not know.</line>
            <line>Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands</line>

            <line>By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother</line>
            <line>Made wars upon me; and their contestation</line>
            <line>Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</line>

            <speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>You do mistake your business; my brother never</line>
            <line>Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;</line>
            <line>And have my learning from some true reports,</line>
            <line>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</line>
            <line>Discredit my authority with yours;</line>
            <line>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</line>
            <line>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</line>
            <line>Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,</line>
            <line>As matter whole you have not to make it with,</line>
            <line>It must not be with this.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
            <line>You praise yourself</line>

            <line>You patch'd up your excuses.</line>

            <line>I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,</line>
            <line>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</line>
            <line>Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,</line>
            <line>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</line>
            <line>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</line>
            <line>I would you had her spirit in such another:</line>
            <line>The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle</line>

            <line>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</line>
            <line>Of what I was i' the morning: but next day</line>
            <line>I told him of myself; which was as much</line>
            <line>As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow</line>

            <line>The water which they beat to follow faster,</line>
            <line>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</line>
