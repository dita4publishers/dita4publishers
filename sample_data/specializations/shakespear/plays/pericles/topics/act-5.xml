            <line>For every graff would send a caterpillar,</line>

            <line>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</line>
            <line>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:</line>
            <line>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</line>
            <line>Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,</line>
            <line>Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,</line>
            <line>Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:</line>
            <line>In Helicanus may you well descry</line>
            <line>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:</line>
            <line>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</line>
            <line>The worth that learned charity aye wears:</line>
            <line>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</line>
            <line>Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name</line>
            <line>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</line>
            <line>That him and his they in his palace burn;</line>
            <line>The gods for murder seemed so content</line>
            <line>To punish them; although not done, but meant.</line>
            <line>So, on your patience evermore attending,</line>
            <line>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</line>
