         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</line>
            <line>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</line>
            <line>Will you sit down?</line>
            <line>And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!</line>
            <line>I have forgot the map.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>No, here it is.</line>
            <line>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,</line>
            <line>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</line>
            <line>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with</line>
            <line>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>I cannot blame him: at my nativity</line>
            <line>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</line>
            <line>Of burning cressets; and at my birth</line>
            <line>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</line>
            <line>Shaked like a coward.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if</line>
            <line>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself</line>
            <line>had never been born.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>I say the earth did shake when I was born.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</line>
            <line>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</line>
            <line>And not in fear of your nativity.</line>
            <line>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</line>
            <line>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</line>
            <line>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd</line>
            <line>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</line>
            <line>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</line>
            <line>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</line>
            <line>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</line>
            <line>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,</line>
            <line>In passion shook.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Cousin, of many men</line>
            <line>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</line>
            <line>To tell you once again that at my birth</line>
            <line>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</line>
            <line>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</line>
            <line>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</line>
            <line>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</line>
            <line>And all the courses of my life do show</line>
            <line>I am not in the roll of common men.</line>
            <line>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</line>
            <line>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</line>
            <line>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</line>
            <line>And bring him out that is but woman's son</line>
            <line>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</line>
            <line>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.</line>
            <line>I'll to dinner.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Why, so can I, or so can any man;</line>
            <line>But will they come when you do call for them?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</line>
            <line>The devil.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</line>
            <line>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</line>
            <line>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</line>
            <line>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</line>
            <line>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</line>
            <line>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</line>
            <line>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</line>
            <line>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</line>
            <line>How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right</line>
            <line>According to our threefold order ta'en?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>The archdeacon hath divided it</line>
            <line>Into three limits very equally:</line>
            <line>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</line>
            <line>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</line>
            <line>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</line>
            <line>And all the fertile land within that bound,</line>
            <line>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</line>
            <line>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</line>
            <line>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</line>
            <line>Which being sealed interchangeably,</line>
            <line>A business that this night may execute,</line>
            <line>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</line>
            <line>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</line>
            <line>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</line>
            <line>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</line>
            <line>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</line>
            <line>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</line>
            <line>Within that space you may have drawn together</line>
            <line>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:</line>
            <line>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;</line>
            <line>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</line>
            <line>For there will be a world of water shed</line>
            <line>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</line>
            <line>In quantity equals not one of yours:</line>
            <line>See how this river comes me cranking in,</line>
            <line>And cuts me from the best of all my land</line>
            <line>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</line>
            <line>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</line>
            <line>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</line>
            <line>In a new channel, fair and evenly;</line>
            <line>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</line>
            <line>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Yea, but</line>
            <line>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</line>
            <line>With like advantage on the other side;</line>
            <line>Gelding the opposed continent as much</line>
            <line>As on the other side it takes from you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</line>
            <line>And on this north side win this cape of land;</line>
            <line>And then he runs straight and even.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>I'll not have it alter'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Will not you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>No, nor you shall not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Who shall say me nay?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Why, that will I.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;</line>
            <line>For I was train'd up in the English court;</line>
            <line>Where, being but young, I framed to the harp</line>
            <line>Many an English ditty lovely well</line>
            <line>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</line>
            <line>A virtue that was never seen in you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>Marry,</line>
            <line>And I am glad of it with all my heart:</line>
            <line>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</line>
            <line>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;</line>
            <line>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,</line>
            <line>Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;</line>
            <line>And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</line>
            <line>Nothing so much as mincing poetry:</line>
            <line>'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land</line>
            <line>To any well-deserving friend;</line>
            <line>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</line>
            <line>I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</line>
            <line>Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
            <line>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:</line>
            <line>I'll haste the writer and withal</line>
            <line>Break with your wives of your departure hence:</line>
            <line>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</line>
            <line>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit GLENDOWER</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
            <line>I cannot choose: sometime he angers me</line>
            <line>With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,</line>
            <line>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</line>
            <line>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</line>
            <line>A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,</line>
            <line>A couching lion and a ramping cat,</line>
            <line>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</line>
            <line>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;</line>
            <line>He held me last night at least nine hours</line>
            <line>In reckoning up the several devils' names</line>
            <line>That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'</line>
            <line>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious</line>
            <line>As a tired horse, a railing wife;</line>
            <line>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live</line>
            <line>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</line>
            <line>Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</line>
            <line>In any summer-house in Christendom.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</line>
            <line>Exceedingly well read, and profited</line>
            <line>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion</line>
            <line>And as wondrous affable and as bountiful</line>
            <line>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</line>
            <line>He holds your temper in a high respect</line>
            <line>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</line>
            <line>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:</line>
            <line>I warrant you, that man is not alive</line>
            <line>Might so have tempted him as you have done,</line>
            <line>Without the taste of danger and reproof:</line>
            <line>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
            <line>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;</line>
            <line>And since your coming hither have done enough</line>
            <line>To put him quite beside his patience.</line>
            <line>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:</line>
            <line>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--</line>
            <line>And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--</line>
            <line>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</line>
            <line>Defect of manners, want of government,</line>
            <line>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:</line>
            <line>The least of which haunting a nobleman</line>
            <line>Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain</line>
            <line>Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</line>
            <line>Beguiling them of commendation.</line>

            <line>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</line>
            <line>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</line>
            <line>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</line>
            <line>And art almost an alien to the hearts</line>
            <line>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</line>
            <line>The hope and expectation of thy time</line>
            <line>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</line>
            <line>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</line>
            <line>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</line>
            <line>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</line>
            <line>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</line>
            <line>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</line>
            <line>Had still kept loyal to possession</line>
            <line>And left me in reputeless banishment,</line>
            <line>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</line>
            <line>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</line>
            <line>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</line>
            <line>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</line>
            <line>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</line>
            <line>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</line>
            <line>And dress'd myself in such humility</line>
            <line>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</line>
            <line>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</line>
            <line>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</line>
            <line>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</line>
            <line>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</line>
            <line>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</line>
            <line>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</line>

            <line>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</line>

            <line>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</line>
            <line>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</line>
            <line>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</line>
            <line>And gave his countenance, against his name,</line>
            <line>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</line>
            <line>Of every beardless vain comparative,</line>
            <line>Grew a companion to the common streets,</line>
            <line>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</line>
            <line>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</line>
            <line>They surfeited with honey and began</line>
            <line>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</line>
            <line>More than a little is by much too much.</line>
            <line>So when he had occasion to be seen,</line>
            <line>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</line>
            <line>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</line>
            <line>As, sick and blunted with community,</line>
            <line>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</line>
            <line>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</line>
            <line>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</line>
            <line>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</line>
            <line>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</line>
            <line>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</line>
            <line>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</line>
            <line>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</line>

            <line>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</line>
            <line>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</line>

            <line>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</line>
            <line>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</line>

            <line>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</line>

            <line>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</line>
            <line>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</line>
            <line>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</line>
            <line>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</line>
            <line>woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</line>
            <line>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</line>
            <line>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</line>
            <line>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</line>
            <line>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</line>
            <line>were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</line>
            <line>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</line>
