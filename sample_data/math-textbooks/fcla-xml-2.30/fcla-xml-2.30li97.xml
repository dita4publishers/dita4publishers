<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &#x201C;free&#x201D; in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
others.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   This License is a kind of &#x201C;copyleft&#x201D;, which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.
                                                                          

                                                                          
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is
not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or

 id="Q1-98-428"></a></p></div>
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license,
unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
<span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Document&#x201D;</span>, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the
public is a licensee, and is addressed as <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;you&#x201D;</span>. You accept the license if you copy,
modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
law.
</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   A <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Modified Version&#x201D; </span>of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   A <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Secondary Section&#x201D; </span>is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document&#x2019;s overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section
may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter
of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Invariant Sections&#x201D; </span>are certain Secondary Sections whose
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If
                                                                          

                                                                          
the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
none.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Cover Texts&#x201D; </span>are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p><!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   A <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Transparent&#x201D; </span>copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic
text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or
(for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &#x201C;Transparent&#x201D; is called
<span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Opaque&#x201D;</span>.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Title Page&#x201D; </span>means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to
appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any
title page as such, &#x201C;Title Page&#x201D; means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work&#x2019;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   A section <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Entitled XYZ&#x201D; </span>means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
name mentioned below, such as <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Acknowledgements&#x201D;</span>, <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Dedications&#x201D;</span>,
<span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Endorsements&#x201D;</span>, or <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;History&#x201D;</span>.) To <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#x201C;Preserve the Title&#x201D; </span>of such a section
                                                                          

                                                                          
when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &#x201C;Entitled XYZ&#x201D;
according to this definition.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers
are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as
regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this
License.

<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control
the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
3.
</p><!--l. 175--><p class="indent" >   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.

 id="Q1-98-430"></a></p></div>
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#x2019;s license
notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly
identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You
                                                                          

                                                                          
may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.
</p><!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover,
and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
location from which the general network-using public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.
</p><!--l. 216--><p class="indent" >   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
